Topic idea: What will it actually do?
Solve the sudoku, take a refule picture to figure out the answer of the graphic.
The python will apply openCV to seperate the image to make each box be clear, and KNN machine learning model will detect the actual value inside the box. The additional print (the first 2D array print will helps to recognize the result). 
The KNN model was be traned by several common type font to learn the typical word writing type, and analyz the capture the functiotn get from openCV.
Unfortunately, the accuracy of the number detection haven't pass 65% in my test, KNN might can be apply with PCA or more learning model to increase the accuracy. 
The following up with the main transition language PHP, I use PHP to calling the XML-RPC and rest API( for further communication).
PHP provides strong connecting methods and optimize program algorithm. Therefore, during my plan the PHP step will handle the solution search and passing the value.
The go being the last calling for local storage, my plan to use with dataset or heap memory when I start the project, but unfortunately that I cannot set up properly during this project. ( I use the CSV file to replace these function, and leave more setup for further possible updat.)
As the mention above, the PHP handling the main communication with two communication language API and XML-RPC.
The  "docker-compose up" will helps to start and run the project.
The main idea I would like to share in this project is about the modification of OpenCV, KNN learning model applicationm, XML-RPC and API set up.
The topic idea is from my previous class in CMPT 353 and 354, and I want to make it life closer.
Take the Python apply machine learning in type of font, train the machine to acknowledge the latter well.

The three programming languages you will use, and (briefly) what will be implemented with each.
This program I plan to use Python Go and php.
python is the strong language that I learn in my academic journey, the machine learning and deep learning are excited.
PHP is a main language that handling the future of front end system, it helps to manage and API or XML process.
The main core language I choose Go, the one I learn in this term. The flexability and concurrancy is the main effect I choose with it.

The two inter-language communication methods you will use.
The inter-language will applied with XML-RPC and rest API.
XML is a strong language that can pass ton of information in the system. And it mostly will avoid the system issue.
Since my laptop was confusing the Java.mvn issue during the build of container, it will mostly fail my work. 
Sadly that I am not able to choose the RibbatMQ with java in priority.

Deployment technology: Vagrant VM, or Docker containers.
Docker is the most powerful system I haven't seen, as my knowledge, I learn the docker can be the syetem server for while in remote environment.
Therefore, this project give me a chance to try and learn more with it.


start the docker with docker-compose up -d 
The syetem will take around 40 seconds to get the model of Machine Learning.
And pass the result the python ditect to PHP for API and XMLrpc syetem
the return to python will be with the answer. 
and print the sample.csv to the main file.
